redmine_on_debian
=================

Setup  Redmine On Debian with PG, Unicorn, and Nginx in a flash.

Tested on fresh Digital Ocean droplet running Debian 7 x64. Not tested in any other environments so ymmv.

Note: this script uses Debian packages, so please be aware of any limitations this may bring. Everything is pretty much the most up to date versions that are compatible with Redmine using SID sources.

Redmine   => 2.3.1.stable  
Ruby      => 1.9.3  
Rails     => 3.2.13  
Postgres  => 9.1
